    "## Option 1. Food Delivery Service Database\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objective**: Design a database to support a food delivery appâ€™s logistics and orders.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Schema design**: \n",
    "The app lists several restaurants of different cousines. Each retaurant has a different menu comprising items and prices (and calories if you like).\n",
    "The database represents customers with a home address, identified by their cell phone. \n",
    "Customer place orders to a specific restaurant selecting items from the menu and their quantity.\n",
    "The database matches delivery drivers (identified by their cellphones too) to orders. A delivery is initiated from an order and once completed contains the delivery status, and tip amount. Upon each delivery, the customer and the driver give each other star rankings 1-5.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Generate data**: \n",
    "Populate at least three restaurants with at least ten menu items each. Populate at least 20 customers and 5 drivers. Generate at least 100 orders and deliveries.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tips:\n",
    "* Potential tables: Restaurant, Menu, MenuItem, Customer, Driver, Order, OrderItem, Delivery\n",
    "* You may use faker to generate test data\n",
    "* You make ask ChatGPT (or your AI of choice) to generate more interesting data such as menus and prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Queries**\n",
    "1. List all restaurants, including their average menu item price\n",
    "2. Pick a customer and list all the orders that he or she has placed in the past month, including the total amount on each order and the tip.\n",
    "3. Show all restaurants with their total numbers of orders and total sales amounts.\n",
    "4. Show all customers with who tip more than 15% on average and have 4-star rating or better.\n",
    "5. Pick a driver and list all the customers that have given him 2-star rating or worse.\n",
    "6. Come up with your own fancy query and explain it.\n"

The skill must come from a given lookup table. The database also contains empoyers and their job postings with required skills and proficiency levels, and a salary range. A candidate is a job seeker who has applied for a specific job posting. Only one applicaton is allowed per posting from each seeker.\n",
